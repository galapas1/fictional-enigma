eCFR Project Submission

For a description of the coding challenge, see ./docs/Senior_Full_Stack_Engineer_Exercise.pdf

The solution is developed entirely in Terraform, employing a Swagger OpenApi specification to manage the endpoints exposed by AWS API Gateway where the Swagger OpenApi includes the requisite x-amazon-apigateway-integration definition to provision the requisite Request and Response templates.

See the ./docs/eCFR_Project_Overview.pdf for a quick project overview.
